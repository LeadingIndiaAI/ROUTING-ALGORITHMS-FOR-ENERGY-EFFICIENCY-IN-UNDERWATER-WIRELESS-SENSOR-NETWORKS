# Routing-Algorithms-For-Enenrgy-Efficiency-In-UWSNs

Underwater Wireless Sensor Network is a field of rapid growth and development. This is because 70% of world is in water and it is still unexplored. The UWSNs are quite different than the normal terrestrial networks. This is the because the environment is different and the challenges increases due to that.

This research is focused on reducing the energy consumption in the UWSNs. The communication in this UWSNs are done by using sensor nodes which are battery operated and is difficult to recharge these batteries un-derwater. Also a difficult challenge is to decide the cluster heads among various nodes present in the network. 

This project examines the algorithm implementation for effective routing in order to have effective use of energy to improve efficiency. It also anchors the analytical method to have an effective clustering method to minimize the use of energy. The main purpose of this project is to in-crease the lifetime of the underwater wireless sensor networks by reducing the energy cost used during each transmission and during receiving of data packets.

The simulation is done in Matlab and the attached code can be used for future purpose to optimise more and more in the field of underwater wireless sensor networks.
This Project is performed at Bennett University,Greater Noida on 17 June 2020.
